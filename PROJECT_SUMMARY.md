# Project Summary: Secure Geofenced Password Manager

## üéâ What We Built

You now have a fully functional **Secure Password Manager with Geofencing** - a unique application that combines traditional password management with location-based security. This is a working demonstration of your research project on "*Implementation of a Secure Password Management System Using Geofencing and Asymmetric Encryption Techniques*".

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Frontend Application
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks and local state

### Security Implementation
- **Encryption**: AES encryption using crypto-js
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- **Geofencing**: Browser Geolocation API with Haversine distance calculation
- **Storage**: Encrypted localStorage (zero-knowledge architecture)

### Core Components Built

1. **Setup Component** (`src/components/setup.tsx`)
   - Master password creation with validation
   - Trusted location configuration
   - Initial app setup workflow

2. **Login Component** (`src/components/login.tsx`)
   - Master password authentication
   - Password hashing and verification
   - User-friendly error handling

3. **Password Vault** (`src/components/password-vault.tsx`)
   - Full CRUD operations for passwords
   - Real-time geofencing checks
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality

4. **Geolocation Hook** (`src/hooks/useGeolocation.ts`)
   - Real-time location monitoring
   - Trusted zone validation
   - Permission handling

5. **Utility Functions** (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
   - Encryption/decryption utilities
   - Distance calculations (Haversine formula)
   - Local storage management
   - Security helpers

## üîê Security Features Implemented

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Something you know**: Master password
- **Somewhere you are**: Trusted locations (geofencing)

### Encryption & Privacy
- **AES Encryption**: All passwords encrypted before storage
- **Salt-based Hashing**: Unique salt for each user
- **Zero-Knowledge**: No data transmitted to servers
- **Local-Only Storage**: Everything stays on the user's device

### Geofencing Technology
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Location checked every 30 seconds
- **Configurable Radius**: 50-1000 meters per trusted location
- **Multiple Locations**: Support for home, office, and travel locations
- **Automatic Locking**: Vault locks when outside trusted zones

## üéØ Key Innovations

1. **Physical Security Layer**: First password manager to use geofencing as primary security
2. **Zero-Server Architecture**: Complete offline functionality
3. **Real-time Protection**: Immediate response to location changes
4. **User-Friendly Setup**: Simple onboarding for complex security
